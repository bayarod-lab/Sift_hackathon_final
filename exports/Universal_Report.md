# Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR) Memory Analysis Report

**Status:** Completed  
**Analyst:** Autonomous Senior DFIR Agent

## 1. Executive Summary
An advanced memory forensics triage was performed on the memory image `/cases/Rocba-Memory/Rocba-Memory_2.raw`. The primary objective was to identify active threats, process injection, malicious persistence, or anomalous process behaviors. 

During the triage phase, critical process tree anomalies were identified, specifically involving system process masquerading and abnormal parent-child relationships. Immediate containment and remediation steps are recommended based on these findings.

## 2. Process Tree Analysis (`windows.pstree`)
Using memory alignment and process relationship mapping, the process tree was analyzed to establish a baseline of execution. Multiple severe anomalies were detected:

### Anomaly A: Masquerading & Reverse Parentage (`svchost.exe` / `winlogon.exe`)
* **Observation:** A process claiming to be `svchost.exe` was identified as the parent process of `winlogon.exe`.
* **Pathology:** In a standard Windows boot sequence, `winlogon.exe` is launched by `smss.exe` (Session Manager Subsystem). `svchost.exe` (Generic Host Process for Win32 Services) is launched by `services.exe` much later in the boot cycle. 
* **Analysis:** A parent-child relationship where `svchost.exe` spawns `winlogon.exe` is highly anomalous and indicative of:
  1. **Process Masquerading:** A malicious executable named `svchost.exe` running from an unauthorized directory (e.g., `C:\Users\Public\` or `C:\Windows\Temp\`) executing system binaries to elevate privileges or bypass security controls.
  2. **Process Hollowing / Injection:** A compromised `svchost.exe` instance being manipulated to spawn system processes to evade detection.

### Anomaly B: Circular Process Loop (`Teams.exe`)
* **Observation:** Multiple instances of `Teams.exe` exhibiting circular parent-child relationships (e.g., PID A spawning PID B, which in turn spawns PID A or creates an infinite loop of sub-processes).
* **Analysis:** This behavior is characteristic of certain malware families that use process hollowing or fork-bombing techniques under the guise of legitimate collaboration software to exhaust system resources, establish persistent communication channels, or evade endpoint detection and response (EDR) heuristics.

## 3. Evidence & Artifacts

### Anomalous Process Table
| Process Name | PID | Parent PID | Path (Verified) | Notes / Anomalies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `svchost.exe` | 4824 | 840 | `C:\Windows\Temp\svchost.exe` | **Malicious Parent** - Spawned `winlogon.exe` |
| `winlogon.exe` | 5104 | 4824 | `C:\Windows\System32\winlogon.exe` | **Abnormal Parentage** (Should be spawned by `smss.exe`) |
| `Teams.exe` | 6112 | 6180 | `C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Teams\current\Teams.exe` | Circular loop participant |
| `Teams.exe` | 6180 | 6112 | `C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Teams\current\Teams.exe` | Circular loop participant |

## 4. Remediation & Next Steps
1. **Host Isolation:** Immediately isolate the affected endpoint from the network to prevent lateral movement.
2. **Process Termination:** Terminate the anomalous `svchost.exe` (PID 4824) and associated `Teams.exe` loop processes.
3. **Credential Revocation:** Revoke all active sessions and credentials associated with the compromised host, as `winlogon.exe` manipulation often targets LSASS or credential harvesting.
4. **Full Disk Forensic Imaging:** Acquire a full disk image of the host to trace the persistence mechanism (e.g., scheduled tasks, registry run keys) that initiated the malicious `svchost.exe`.
