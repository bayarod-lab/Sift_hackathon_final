# 🕵️‍♂️ ATP: Autonomous DFIR Triage Pipeline
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

**Elevator Pitch:** An autonomous, multi-agent DFIR orchestrator that dynamically scales to your AI model's power for rapid, defensible evidence triage. Built for the SANS FIND EVIL Hackathon 2026.

## 🏗️ Architecture Diagram

![Architecture Diagram](docs/Diagram.png)[cite: 18]

**Classification Architecture Strategy:** 
This orchestrator executes under an **Alternative Agentic IDE** pattern (utilizing Aider). A clear visual showing how components connect—the agent, SIFT tools, MCP servers, evidence sources, and output pipeline—is provided above. Evidence integrity is enforced via strict architectural isolation layers (OS-level decoupled extraction via `fls`/`ewfmount`/`7z`) rather than soft prompt controls. The Aider `--read` flag creates a hard boundary, ensuring original forensic data blocks remain completely read-only even if an intermediate model execution fails.

## 🚀 Key Features & Functionality

* **Hybrid Capability Discovery Engine:** A real-world systems utility that queries your active AI model's footprint via `litellm`. If the underlying platform reveals a next-generation architecture (such as `gemini-3.5-flash`), it expands the context processing ceiling up to 1,000 log lines per asset file.
* **Dual-Decoupled Account Guardrails:** The pipeline separates model strength from your active account quota billing tier. Users running state-of-the-art models via free API keys are protected by an automated 45-second fallback cooldown buffer to proactively block `429 Resource Exhausted` errors.
* **Phase-Aware Multi-Agent Peer Review Loops:** Ingestion tasks map across distinct logical levels. An initial staging loop sets basic telemetry criteria, followed by a Senior Forensic Review Loop that systematically critiques the raw file systems, flags hidden attribution anomalies, identifies evasion tactics, and writes independent `critique.txt` audit summaries.
* **Self-Healing Schema Guardrails:** Implements programmatic validation loops paired with regex string cleaners (`sed`). If a model attempts to introduce UI progress meters or markdown block pollution, the system intercepts the hallucination and guides automated script self-corrections.
* **Defensive Specificity Calibration:** Prompt criteria prioritize forensic fidelity. The pipeline explicitly handles dual-use system elements (like disk encryption matrices or network monitoring installations) as baseline exceptions, demanding objective context indicators before jumping to malicious threat assumptions.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites & Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

This platform is optimized for seamless deployment inside native Linux environments and purpose-built for the SANS SIFT Workstation platform. These step-by-step instructions allow judges to run the agent locally against provided evidence.

### 1. Ingest System Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Install the background forensic utilities, compression layouts, and PDF rendering backends required by your host system:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y python3-weasyprint pango1.0-tools p7zip-full ewf-tools sleuthkit
2. Clone the Repository
Bash
git clone [https://github.com/bayarod-lab/Sift_hackathon.git](https://github.com/bayarod-lab/Sift_hackathon.git)
cd Sift_hackathon
3. Install Package Frameworks
Install the corresponding underlying Python reporting and agentic automation scripts:  
MD

Bash
pip3 install weasyprint aider-chat litellm
4. Configure Authentication & Workspace Parameters
The analytical pipeline queries Gemini API environments for core automated reasoning steps. Export your variables along with your choice of testing configurations directly into your open shell session.[cite: 18]

Note for Judges: You must supply a valid Google AI Studio API key with internet access to run the cognitive reasoning engine locally.

[cite: 18]

Bash
# Set your active Google AI Studio Key
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# [Optional Override] Set your target execution model (Defaults to gemini-3.1-flash-lite)
export AI_MODEL="gemini/gemini-3.5-flash"

# [Optional Override] Scale performance parameters by designating billing profile (FREE or PAID)
export API_TIER="FREE"
🚀 Usage Guide (Local Execution)
The triage workspace executes via a single orchestrator loop. Simply pass your direct path vector target as an input parameter argument.[cite: 18]

To execute analysis on standard VIGÍA telemetry cases:

Bash
./analyze.sh "reference_material/telemetry_source.json"
To process a compressed forensic archive matrix (such as the ROCBA triage dataset):

Bash
./analyze.sh "evidence/Rocba-Memory.zip"
To handle raw disk capture structures or EnCase split collections via automated mount logic:

Bash
sudo -E ./analyze.sh "evidence/rocba-cdrive.e01"
(Note: Executing against .e01 elements requires passing sudo -E flags to provide structural device mounting permissions while cleanly maintaining your environmental variables for the automated engine).

📜 Agent Execution Logs
All automated workflows enforce an append-only transaction layer. Structured logs showing the full agent communication, tool execution sequence, and multi-agent peer review steps are captured. Judges can trace any finding back to the specific iteration-over-iteration trace that produced it.[cite: 18] The system ran successfully against the VIGIA-REAL-001 dataset, and the verified logs with timestamps and agent-to-agent messages are directly accessible below:
